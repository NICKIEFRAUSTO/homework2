portfolio project
This project was created for a potential employer to review a sample of work.
The portfolio presents links to projects, a navigation bar with links an about me page.

I used the CSS framwork Bulma to create this site.

    notes:
:I had a lot of trouble with the flex-grow for my first card. 
I tried adding an id as well an adding flex-grow 4 to the value in css as well as other things, but I could not get the card to respond and be larger than the other 2. 
I even tried adding class=card1 to the first card and naming the other cards class=card2 and creating the css codes for .card1 and .card2 with no avail...

I also can not add the screenshot to this readme file, but I have included it in my images file.
