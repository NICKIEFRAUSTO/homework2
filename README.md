portfolio project
This project was created for a potential employer to review a sample of work.
The portfolio presents my name, a recent photo, links to sections: About, Work and Contact
Clicking on the link will jump to the corresponding section

    I created 4 sections to display with the flex-box style. 
    and used media screen to adjust for different screen sizes.

    notes:
:I had a lot of trouble with the flex-grow for my first card. 
I tried adding an id as well an adding flex-grow 4 to the value in css as well as other things, but I could not get the card to respond and be larger than the other 2. 
I even tried adding class=card1 to the first card and naming the other cards class=card2 and creating the css codes for .card1 and .card2 with no avail...

I also can not add the screenshot to this readme file, but I have included it in my images file.
